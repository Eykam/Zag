If a switch does not find a destination MAC address in its MAC address table, it will handle the frame using a process called "flooding." Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of what happens:

Flooding
Frame Reception: The switch receives a frame on one of its ports. It checks the destination MAC address of the frame against its MAC address table.
MAC Address Lookup: If the destination MAC address is not found in the MAC address table, the switch treats the frame as if the destination is unknown.
Flooding the Frame: The switch floods the frame to all ports except the one on which it was received. This means the frame is sent out on all other ports connected to other devices or network segments.
Handling by Connected Devices: Each connected device or segment receives the frame. Only the device with the matching destination MAC address will process and accept the frame. All other devices will discard it.
Example Scenario
Consider a switch with four ports and a MAC address table:

+-----------------------+
|       Switch          |
| +-------------------+ |
| | MAC Address       | |
| | Table             | |
| |                   | |
| | MAC Address   | Port |
| | ------------- | ---- |
| | AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01 | 1 |
| | AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02 | 2 |
| +-------------------+ |
+-----------------------+
     |       |       |       |
   Port 1  Port 2  Port 3  Port 4
    /        |        |        \
Device A  Device B  Device C  Device D
(MAC:     (MAC:     (MAC:     (MAC:
AA:BB:CC: AA:BB:CC: CC:DD:EE: DD:EE:FF:
DD:EE:01) DD:EE:02) CC:DD:EE: CC:DD:EE:
                           1)        04)
                           2)        
Steps
Device A Sends a Frame to Device C:

Source MAC Address: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01
Destination MAC Address: CC:DD:EE:FF:00:03
Switch Receives the Frame on Port 1:

The switch updates its MAC address table with the source MAC address (AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01) and associates it with Port 1.
The switch looks up the destination MAC address (CC:DD:EE:FF:00:03) in its MAC address table but does not find it.
Flooding the Frame:

Since the destination MAC address is not found, the switch floods the frame to all ports except Port 1 (the port on which the frame was received).
The frame is sent out on Ports 2, 3, and 4.
Devices B, C, and D Receive the Frame:

Device B checks the destination MAC address and discards the frame (it does not match its own MAC address).
Device C checks the destination MAC address, finds a match (CC:DD:EE:FF:00:03), and processes the frame.
Device D checks the destination MAC address and discards the frame (it does not match its own MAC address).
Updating the MAC Address Table
After Device C responds to Device A, the switch will learn the MAC address of Device C:

Device C Responds to Device A:

Source MAC Address: CC:DD:EE:FF:00:03
Destination MAC Address: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01
Switch Receives the Frame on Port 3:

The switch updates its MAC address table with the source MAC address (CC:DD:EE:FF:00:03) and associates it with Port 3.
The switch looks up the destination MAC address (AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01) and finds it associated with Port 1.
The switch forwards the frame to Port 1, where Device A receives it.
Conclusion
When a MAC address is not found in a switch's MAC address table, the switch floods the frame to all ports except the one it was received on. This ensures that the frame reaches its intended destination even if the switch does not initially know where that destination is. As devices communicate, the switch learns the MAC addresses and updates its table, allowing it to forward future frames more efficiently.
